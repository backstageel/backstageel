![Full Stack Web Developer & Data Analyst](https://github.com/backstageel/backstageel/blob/main/elisioleonardo.png?raw=true)

I'm a software engineer and data analyst who is passionate about solving problems using technology, creating technology to elevate people and their business, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include PHP, Laravel, AWS, Python and GraphQL. I currently work as Data Analyst on Syrah Resources and collaborate on various open source projects on Github. My interest in the Laravel ecosystem led me to launch my first SaaS product, a Personal Finances Management System called MyChi.

Skills: PHP, MySQL, AWS, Laravel
